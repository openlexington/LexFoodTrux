# LexFoodTrux (Dude, where's my taco?)

## Raison D'etre

So there's this web site at
[LexBeerScene](http://lexbeerscene.com/foodtruckevents) that someone ([is it
you?](mailto:someone@example.com?Subject=LexFoodTrux%20I%20do%it)) keeps and up
to date calendar of where our local food trucks will be. This is great! But
what if I want toiew this data another way? What to know where the nearest
truck is based on where I am at a certain time?

Here we will make a little process to scrape said webpage, semanticize the data
it presents, detect changes, and publish it as an API for all to consume!
